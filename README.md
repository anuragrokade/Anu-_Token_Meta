# Anu_Token_Meta
This course was designed to introduce about some very basic concepts of Web3 and get started with solidity programming. I learnt various concepts of Solidity like Variables, Datatypes, Functions, etc. Now, as a submission, there is challenge to get all these things to work and the challenge is to make my own token.

## Preface

I have created my own token named "Anu" abbreviated as "Rag". There is the record of its total supply. And if someone mints some "Rag" tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if someone burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply (Only if there is enough balance).

## Getting Started
I wrote the code in Solidity Language, and I used Metacrafters ETH Proof as my learning resource which helped me creating this project.

### Installing

* I just used the Online Remix IDE for implementation of  the solidity code.
* Then I created a file in this repository named Solidity_pro.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### Executing program

* If you are using Remix IDE, you can simply compile the code from the side menu.
* After compiling, you have to deploy the Contract from the side bar itself. And after deploying you have to enter certain inputs that the Smart Contract requires for minting and burning the tokens and also for checking the balance.

## Help

I would highly recommending checking the Metacrafters academy for more such content. They helped me a lot, as their discord server was pretty active with all the community members being so nice and helpful!
